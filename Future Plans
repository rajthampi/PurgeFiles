I want to add the following enhancements to the current project

A GUI that will allow users to select a folder

Once the target folder is selected, the software will automatically list all unique/distinct file types in a grid

Users can opt which types of files should be purged against defined age

Should allow the users to edit their choices at later stages like removing file types or changing the age of files
